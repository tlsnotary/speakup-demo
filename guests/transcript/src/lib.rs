//! A Speakup demo guest: selective disclosure over an HTTP transcript.
//!
//! The host parses the transcript ONCE outside the VM (with the real
//! `transcript-verify` host parser) and writes the resulting span table —
//! plus the public claims: method, target, `Host`, status, and a JSON
//! path — into [`TABLE`] as **public** words. Public data stays concrete
//! inside the VM, so all control flow (header loops, the JSON tree walk)
//! is driven by it. The raw `sent`/`recv` bytes are **private**; the
//! verifier learns only the table (the *structure* of the exchange), the
//! claims, and the disclosed value.
//!
//! The verification logic lives in [`transcript_core`] (shared with the
//! host, which cross-checks every encoding natively): the public table
//! drives a cursor over the private bytes and every claim is re-derived
//! branch-free — literal anchors, charset gates, header tiling,
//! Content-Length digits, the full JSON grammar — into one `ok` flag.
//!
//! Revealed: the 0/1 flag and — in disclose mode — the bytes of the JSON
//! value at the public path (masked to zeros unless `ok`). In assert mode
//! the flag alone: "the value equals the public expected string" is folded
//! into it. Everything else stays hidden.
